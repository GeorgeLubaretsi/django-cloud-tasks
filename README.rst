============================
Django Cloud Tasks
============================
Integrate `Google Cloud Tasks <https://goo.gl/Ya0AZd>`_ with Django.

Package provides easy to use decorator to create task handlers.

App looks for tasks in ``cloud_tasks.py`` files in your installed applications and auto-registers them.

Package is in early alpha and it does not have any real security at the moment. You need to authorize requests coming
to your instances yourself.

Prerequisites
=============

- Django 1.8+
- Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6

Dependencies
============

- `google-api-python-client <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/google-api-python-client/>`_

Documentation
=============

Installation
============

(1) Install latest version from Github (PyPy package will be available as soon as stable version is released):

    .. code-block:: sh

        pip install -e git+git@github.com:GeorgeLubaretsi/django-cloud-tasks.git#egg=django_cloud_tasks


(2) Add ``django_cloud_tasks`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

    .. code-block:: python

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            # ...
            'django_cloud_tasks',
            # ...
        )


(3) Add configuration to your settings

    .. code-block:: python

        DJANGO_CLOUD_TASKS={
            'project_location_name': 'projects/{project_name}/locations/us-central1',
            'task_handler_root_url': '/_tasks/',
        },

        # This setting allows you to debug your cloud tasks by running actual task handler function locally
        # instead of sending them to the task queue. Default: False
        DJANGO_CLOUD_TASKS_EXECUTE_LOCALLY = False

        # If False, running `.execute()` on remote task will simply log the task data instead of adding it to
        # the queue. Useful for debugging. Default: True
        DJANGO_CLOUD_TASKS_BLOCK_REMOTE_TASKS = False

        # Make sure every payload has a pre-share key in it to confirm request originates from us.
        DJANGO_CLOUD_TASKS_HANDLER_SECRET = '-really-secret-password-'


(4) Add cloud task views to your urls.py (must resolve to the same url as ``task_handler_root_url``)

    .. code-block:: python

        # urls.py
        # ...
        from django.urls import path, include
        from django_cloud_tasks import urls as dct_urls

        urlpatterns = [
            # ...
            path('_tasks/', include(dct_urls)),
        ]



Quick start
===========

Simply import the task decorator and define the task inside ``cloud_tasks.py`` in your app.
First parameter should always be ``request`` which is populated after task is executed by Cloud Task service.

You can get actual request coming from Cloud Task service by accessing ``request.request`` in your task body and
additional attributes such as: ``request.task_id```, ```request.request_headers```

.. code-block:: python

    # cloud_tasks.py
    # ...
    from django_cloud_tasks.decorators import task

    @task(queue='default')
    def example_task(request, p1, p2):
        print(p1, p2)
        print(request.task_id)


Pushing the task to the queue:

.. code-block:: python

    from my_app.cloud_tasks import example_task

    example_task(p1='1', p2='2').execute()


Pushing remote task to the queue (when task handler is defined elsewhere):

.. code-block:: python

    from django_cloud_tasks import remote_task
    from django_cloud_tasks import batch_execute

    example_task = remote_task(queue='my-queue', handler='remote_app.cloud_tasks.example_task'):
    payload_1 = example_task(payload={'p1': 1, 'p2': '2'})
    payload_2 = example_task(payload={'p1': 2, 'p2': '3'})

    # Execute in batch:
    batch_execute([payload_1, payload_2])

    # Or one by one:
    payload_1.execute()
    payload_2.execute()


You can also send tasks in batch if latency is an issue and you have to send many small tasks to the queue
(limited to 1000 at a time):

.. code-block:: python

    from my_app.cloud_tasks import example_task
    from django_cloud_tasks import batch_execute

    tasks = []
    for i in range(0, 420):
        task = example_task(p1=i, p2=i)
        tasks.append(task)

    batch_execute(tasks)



It is also possible to run an actual function using ``run`` method of ``CloudTaskWrapper`` object instance that is returned after task is called (this can be useful for debugging):

.. code-block:: python

    task = example_task(p1=i, p2=i)
    task.run()
